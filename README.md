# vegananda
Everything vegan.

Vegananda is a program that makes it easier to be vegan.

It's made up of three interlinked parts: 

(1) Front-End (Mobile/Web App environment)
(2) Back-End (secure decentralized data structure) 
(3) Blockchain (working with VDao [VeganDAO] to provide sustainable governance & oversight over Vegananda)

From the outset, Vegananda is envisioned as a crowdsourced and decentralized global process. Anyone can edit and improve Vegananda; in fact, the core value proposition of Vegananda can only be realized through network effects of millions of people who will be "seeding" Vegananda's "plantbase" -- underlying distributed database.

(1) FRONT-END (VEGANAPP)

The front-end ("Vegananda App" aka "VeganApp") is designed with simplicity in mind. It allows users to easily upload photos of vegan foods & goods, with machine learning algorithms "reading" the labels and uploading data to the plantbase. This data includes everything from names of products, to bar codes, to lists of ingredients, allergens, and, of course, photos of the underlying products. 

In this VeganAppLite embodiment, users can search for keywords, tags, and product names, to learn about availability of particular products. Did you know, for instance, that there are 432 different types of vegan mozarellas? It'd be cool to know the full list of vegan milks, cheeses, chocolates, wines, and so on. Vegananda solves this clear information gap, first and foremost. 

Even at this rudimentary stage, there's already a LOT of value to be gained from creating a robust global database of vegan goods and consumer products. 

But the front-end capabilities are scaleable to other categories of vegan goods and services, inluding: (A) vegan home-made goods; (B) actual heirloom seeds/plants; (C) e-commerce integration via plugins to existing centralized marketplaces (e.g., Amazon) and decentralized P2P markets & communities; (D) beyond food goods to all vegan goods, from apparel & make-up to the all-vegan Tesla Model X; (E) "Nearby" geo-localized searches for physical stores & local delivery options (real-time delivery a la VeganEats modeled on UberEats); (F) et al. 

The potential utility gains from a robust front-end vegan portal are too numerous to list.

(2) BACK-END (PLANTBASE)

Plantbase is like a seedbank, preserving records of vegan foods, goods, and services for future use.

Plantbase (no affiliation with plantbase.com) is a placeholder name for the secure decentralized data structure behind Vegananda. It's not clear at present whether decentralized data storage is necessary for individual "seeds" (user inputs/records/photos regarding this or that vegan milk, for instance). At first, it might be more optimal to store data (especially photos) on existing commercial-grade clouds. But for other data, such as user account balances and privacy preferences, blockchain integration might be appropriate from the outset. 

Plantbase needs to be decentralized for several reasons: (1) to avoid capture by dominant regulatory or commercial actors; (2) incentivize crowdsourced production of data. If users know from the outset that their data *cannot* be commercialized in ways that go against their consent, they are much more likely to contribute to the massive global crowdsourcing effort. 

A secure immutable data structure also offers unique utility in a decentralized Vegananda economic environment. When users can independently verify list of ingredients, prices, and rankings of goods and services, they derive much more value (and are incentivized to add much more value) relative to an app experience on a centralized corporate-y network (Yelp, Google, which often return high numbers of false-positive "vegan" search results).

To assure high production/service quality, access to the back-end must be distributed in trusted vegan hands. The project must maximize the number of tech-skilled contributors. But core contributors (with full Github access) must be vegan to honor user expectations and prevent dilution of Vegandanda's core competitive advantage (for vegans by vegans).

(3) BLOCKCHAIN 

What's the best way to achieve the objectives of an enterprise-grade UX/UI, incentivize community best efforts, while maintaining sustainable levels of decentralization? Fortunately, blockchain technologies offer a number of tools for running globally distributed and decentralized techno-social networks, like Vegananda. Blockchain governance tools like DAOs are offering ever-increasing levels of functionality and interoperability with existing on-chain and off-chain tech stacks. These tools allow decentralized networks to govern themselves. Good blockchain governance allows us to resolve real-time disputes, thereby maximizing the likelihood of future scaling success.

In the words of a major blockchain platform, "governance is blockchain's killer app."

Vegananda will be governed through a VeganDAO, which will be launched on an as-yet unselected blockchain platform (Ethereum, Aragon, and other platform developers, here's looking at you!). The purpose of the VeganDAO will be to manage Vegandanda's sizeable revenue (principally in the form of referral link revenue and "service donations" from users) and bundles of intellectual property.    

VeganDAO will provide sustainable governance & oversight over Vegananda. VeganDAO stakeholders are directly incentivized to support Vegandanda best efforts in measurable material (though not monetary) terms. If Vegananda succeeds in creating a sustainably scalable global plantbase, VeganDAO members obtain the benefit of an extremely useful economic tool, with daily use potential. To serve its core function of making the world vegan, VeganDAO needs to reinvest the overwhelming majority of its economic gains back into VeganDAO/Vegandanda development efforts. 

VeganDAO's governance is structured so that anyone (from any linguistic and educational background) can see and understand where and how *their* "seeds" and Vegens ("Vegan" + "token" = "Vegens") are being planted.

All this is legal.
